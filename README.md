### Philosopher Virtues app (easy, good for start, practice styling, random quotes)

### Arcade Shooter (Galaga etc)

### Battery status monitor

### Book search

### BTN workouts app

### Calculator

A simple Calculator program with Standard functions or with Scientific functions.  
Basic Arithmetic Operations -> Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide  
Memory Operations -> Save to Memory, Recall from Memory, Clear Memory, Operations History  
Other Operations -> Clear Data (Clears the input area and data from memory)

### Chat bot

### Chatroom

### Client-side photo editor (VSCO/Darkroom app)

### Cloud audio player

### Code search

### Collaborative Etherpad Lite like Markdown editor

### Conference app

This web app should give a functionality both for the conference organizer and the participates.
Main features: information on tracks/talks (speaker bio, links to slides), schedule with push notification on the talks that the user choose.

### Connectivity checker

### Contacts manager

### Countdown timer / Stop watch

### Dashboard

This app should resemble an HR type dashboard where a user can login and view information about the company. It can have an Employee section that shows the information of that employee like Name, Address, Phone, Email, position in company, how long they have been employed, start date, vacation time remaining etc. The app should also have some sort of project tracking. You could include in some graphs and charts that show company progress year over year. One more thing would be to add a place for the HR person to make a company wide announcement that would show up on the company intranet.

### Hand Gesture Detector/Translator

An app that will use device camera as input, detect a person's gestures & movements and translate them into meaningful work i.e. perform some actions based on detected hand gestures. Best use case would be using it for teaching new things to toddlers with sounds and animations. Also, it can make understanding and interaction easier with deaf-dumb people.

### Pizza order composer

Stores people's preferences of toppings, and maybe crust styles too, i.e., what they like, love, dislike, hate, or are neutral to. (Alternate idea: store only the device owner's preferences, and several instances can communicate with each other to collaborate, filling in other people on an ad-hoc basis.) To put together an order, say who's there and how hungry. It should put together an order that will feed everybody, maximize happiness with the toppings, and minimize price. E.g., "1 medium half-pepperoni half-mushroom plus 2 large Hawaiians". It could get prices, and maybe locations, from assorted online sources TBD, or just make assumptions.

### Vine

### Weather app

### Whatâ€™s near me? (Google Maps API)

### WhatsApp Style Messaging App

### Wine cellar (wine manager)
A manager at a high end restaurant needs an app to help manage the restaurants collection of (x) bottles of wine. The manager would like to know the vineyard, location, year, style, location in cellar, how many bottles remain, selling price, buying price, as well as tasting notes. All fields need to be updatable as prices, tasting notes and years will all change frequently. It should have an image of the label/bottle as well. 

### Working parents dinner app

### YouTube API/search client

Using the YouTube API, your app should be able to take in a string, search for the videos and return a list.
For example, if I wanted to watch Cosmos Documantries, must return most related titles, and the 1st related item with large preview ready to play on top.
If you're not specific, searching by one word, for example: "Documantry", it should return up to 10 related results in a column. 
Other example features: 
- 2 columns in one page
- a button to repeat loop an item or list
- play items by random order without repeat
- limit number of results returned, to fit in one page and resize items thumbnail size per amount of videos.
